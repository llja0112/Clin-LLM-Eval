      "1. **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)**: Given the sudden onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, sweating, and nausea, ACS is a strong possibility. This condition can be caused by a blockage in one or more coronary arteries, leading to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.\n",
      "2. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)**: Joseph's symptoms of sudden onset chest pain, shortness of breath, and sweating could also suggest a pulmonary embolism. A PE occurs when a blood clot lodges in an artery in the lung, blocking blood flow and causing these symptoms.\n",
      "3. **Acid Reflux or Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**: Although Joseph has a history of GERD, it's possible that his current symptoms could be related to acid reflux or GERD exacerbation. However, given the severity of his symptoms, I would need to rule out other more serious conditions first.\n",
      "\n",
