      "Patient:\n",

      "\n",
      "Doctor:\n",

      "Doctor:\n",

      "It's understandable to have concerns about serious conditions like cancer, especially when experiencing new symptoms. However, hoarseness is often caused by less serious issues, such as vocal strain, allergies, or infections. A thorough examination will help determine the cause and whether any further testing is needed. If you have any persistent symptoms or concerns, it's always best to follow up with a healthcare professional. Thank you again for your time, and take care!\n",
