2,1,"The Rinne test is specifically designed to differentiate between conductive and sensorineural hearing loss by comparing air conduction to bone conduction, which aligns with the provided justification."
3,1,"The Weber test is similar in purpose to the suggested step, as both aim to identify the nature of unilateral hearing loss."
4,0,"The doctor did not suggest examining the external ear, which would specifically check for deformities, lesions, or signs of trauma."
5,0,"The doctor did not suggest any physical examination step that directly assesses the function of cranial nerves, particularly the vestibulocochlear nerve."
