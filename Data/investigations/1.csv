,Investigations,Justification
0,Electrocardiogram (ECG),To assess for any acute ischemic changes or arrhythmias that may indicate myocardial infarction or other cardiac issues.
1,"Cardiac biomarkers (e.g., troponin levels)","To evaluate for myocardial injury or infarction, especially given the patient's chest pain and risk factors."
2,Chest X-ray,"To rule out any pulmonary causes of chest pain, such as pneumothorax, pneumonia, or aortic dissection."
3,Complete blood count (CBC),To check for signs of infection or anemia that could contribute to the patient's symptoms.
4,Basic metabolic panel (BMP),"To assess electrolyte levels, renal function, and glucose, which can impact cardiac function."
5,Lipid panel,"To evaluate the patient's cholesterol levels and assess cardiovascular risk, especially given his history of high cholesterol."
6,"Esophageal studies (e.g., esophageal pH monitoring or endoscopy)","To investigate the possibility of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as a contributing factor to the chest pain, especially given his history."
7,"Stress test or cardiac imaging (e.g., echocardiogram)","To assess for any underlying coronary artery disease or structural heart issues, especially considering the patient's history of similar episodes."
