,Investigations,Justification
0,Complete Blood Count (CBC),"To assess for anemia or infection, which could be contributing to jaundice."
1,Liver Function Tests (LFTs),"To evaluate liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, which can help determine if the jaundice is due to liver dysfunction."
2,Coagulation Profile,"To check for any bleeding disorders, as liver dysfunction can affect blood clotting."
3,Abdominal Ultrasound,"To visualize the liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts for any structural abnormalities or obstructions."
4,Viral Hepatitis Panel,"To rule out hepatitis A, B, or C as a cause of jaundice."
5,Blood Type and Crossmatch,"In case of hemolytic anemia, which can cause jaundice, knowing the blood type is important for potential transfusions."
6,Reticulocyte Count,To assess bone marrow response and rule out hemolytic anemia.
7,Direct and Indirect Bilirubin Levels,"To differentiate between conjugated and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which can help narrow down the cause of jaundice."
8,Urinalysis,"To check for bilirubin in the urine, which can indicate liver dysfunction or hemolysis."
9,Stool Test for Occult Blood,"To check for gastrointestinal bleeding, which can contribute to anemia and jaundice."
