0,Gastroenteritis,"The patient presents with cramping abdominal pain and nausea, which are common symptoms of gastroenteritis, often caused by viral or bacterial infections."
1,Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS),"The cramping nature of the abdominal pain and the absence of significant gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea or fever suggest IBS, especially in a young patient."
2,Ovarian Cyst Rupture,"Given the patient's gender and age, cramping abdominal pain could be related to a gynecological issue such as a ruptured ovarian cyst, which can cause similar symptoms."
