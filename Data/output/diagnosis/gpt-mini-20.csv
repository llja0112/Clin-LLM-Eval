,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Acute Bronchitis,"The patient has a persistent cough that has progressed from dry to productive with greenish sputum, which is characteristic of bronchitis. The mild fever and discomfort during deep breaths also support this diagnosis."
1,Pneumonia,"The presence of productive cough with greenish sputum, slight fever, and mild discomfort when taking deep breaths raises suspicion for pneumonia, especially given the duration of symptoms."
2,Viral Upper Respiratory Infection (Common Cold),"The initial dry cough and slight fever could indicate a viral infection, which is common and often presents with similar symptoms, although the progression to productive cough suggests a more significant infection."
