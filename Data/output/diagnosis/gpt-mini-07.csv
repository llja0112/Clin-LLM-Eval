,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Muscle strain,"The pain started after lifting a heavy box, which is consistent with a muscle strain, especially given the dull ache and lack of other symptoms."
1,Rotator cuff injury,"The location of the pain around the shoulder and the mechanism of injury (lifting) suggest a possible rotator cuff injury, which is common in similar scenarios."
2,Cardiac-related pain (angina or myocardial infarction),"Given the patient's history of hypertension and the location of the pain in the left arm, it is important to consider cardiac causes, even though the pain is described as dull and there are no other symptoms."
