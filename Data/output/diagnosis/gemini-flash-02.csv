,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Urinary Tract Infection (UTI),"The patient presents with dysuria, hematuria, and increased urinary frequency and urgency, which are common symptoms of UTI."
1,Kidney Stones,"The patient's symptoms of hematuria, dysuria, and increased urinary frequency could be indicative of kidney stones, especially if the pain is severe and localized to the flank or back."
2,Prostatitis,"While the patient denies a family history of prostate problems, prostatitis can still be a possibility, especially given the presence of dysuria and hematuria. However, this is less likely given the lack of fever, chills, or back pain."
