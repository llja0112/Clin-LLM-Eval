,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Hepatitis (viral or autoimmune),"The presence of jaundice, dark urine, and fatigue suggests liver dysfunction, which could be due to hepatitis, especially since there is no history of significant illness or medication use."
1,Cholestasis (biliary obstruction),"The symptoms of jaundice and dark urine without light-colored stools may indicate a blockage in the bile ducts, leading to cholestasis."
2,Alcoholic liver disease,"Given the patient's moderate alcohol consumption, it is possible that liver damage could be contributing to the jaundice, even in the absence of significant past medical history."
