0,Cervical strain/sprain,"The patient experienced neck pain following a minor fall, which is consistent with a muscle strain or ligament sprain in the cervical region."
1,Cervical spondylosis,"Given the patient's age and symptoms of stiffness and limited range of motion, cervical spondylosis (degenerative changes in the cervical spine) could be a contributing factor."
2,Herniated cervical disc,"Although the patient does not report neurological symptoms, a herniated disc could still be a possibility given the neck pain and limited range of motion."
