,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Muscle strain,"The back pain started after lifting a heavy box, which is consistent with a muscle strain, especially given the absence of neurological symptoms."
1,Lumbar sprain,"Similar to a muscle strain, a lumbar sprain can occur from lifting heavy objects and can cause localized pain without neurological deficits."
2,Herniated disc,"While less likely due to the lack of neurological symptoms, a herniated disc could still be a possibility given the nature of the pain and the physical demands of the patient's job."
