0,Endometriosis,"The patient reports sharp, cramping pain during intercourse and spotting afterward, which are common symptoms of endometriosis. Additionally, the recent increase in menstrual pain may suggest the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus."
1,Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID),"The patient's history of a urinary tract infection and current symptoms of pain during intercourse and spotting could indicate PID, which is an infection of the reproductive organs that can cause similar symptoms."
2,Vaginismus,"The sharp pain during intercourse could be related to vaginismus, a condition where involuntary muscle contractions make penetration painful or impossible. This could be exacerbated by anxiety or fear related to the pain."
