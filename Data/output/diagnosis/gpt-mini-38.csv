,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Parkinson's Disease,"Given the gradual onset of tremors, stiffness, and walking difficulties, along with a family history of Parkinson's disease, this is a strong possibility."
1,Essential Tremor,"The presence of tremors without significant cognitive decline or mood changes may suggest essential tremor, especially if the tremors are more pronounced during movement."
2,Multiple Sclerosis (MS),"The combination of tremors, walking difficulties, and balance issues could indicate MS, particularly if there are other neurological symptoms that may develop over time."
