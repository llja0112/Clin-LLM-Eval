,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV),"The patient's description of dizziness, particularly the lightheadedness and off-balance feeling, especially when standing up or moving quickly, is consistent with BPPV. The absence of other symptoms like nausea or headaches further supports this diagnosis."
1,Orthostatic Hypotension,"The patient's history of hypertension and medication for blood pressure, combined with the dizziness upon standing, suggests orthostatic hypotension. The lack of other symptoms like nausea or headaches is also consistent with this diagnosis."
2,Inner Ear Infection (Labyrinthitis),"The patient's report of ringing in the ears (tinnitus) along with dizziness could indicate an inner ear infection. However, the absence of other symptoms like nausea or headaches makes this diagnosis less likely."
