,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT),"The patient presents with sudden sharp pain and mild swelling in the right calf, which are classic symptoms of DVT. The absence of redness or warmth does not rule it out."
1,Muscle Strain or Tear,"The pain started suddenly during prolonged walking, which could indicate a muscle strain or tear in the calf muscle, especially given the sharp and throbbing nature of the pain."
2,Compartment Syndrome,"The presence of localized pain and swelling in the calf raises concern for compartment syndrome, particularly if there is increased pressure within the muscle compartments, although the patient has not reported numbness or tingling."
