0,Plantar Fasciitis,"The sharp heel pain, especially when walking or standing on tiptoes, is characteristic of plantar fasciitis, which is often exacerbated by increased running activity."
1,Achilles Tendinitis,"The sudden onset of heel pain after increased running could indicate Achilles tendinitis, which often presents with pain at the back of the heel and can be aggravated by physical activity."
2,Calcaneal Stress Fracture,"Given the recent increase in running intensity and the sharp pain, a calcaneal stress fracture is a possibility, especially if the pain is localized and worsens with weight-bearing activities."
