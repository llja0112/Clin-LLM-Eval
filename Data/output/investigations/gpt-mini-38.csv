0,Neurological examination,"To assess motor function, reflexes, and coordination, which can help identify signs of Parkinson's disease or other neurological conditions."
1,MRI of the brain,"To rule out structural abnormalities, lesions, or other conditions that could be causing the tremors and walking difficulties."
2,"Blood tests (including thyroid function tests, vitamin B12 levels, and metabolic panel)",To check for metabolic or nutritional deficiencies that could contribute to neurological symptoms.
3,DaTscan (Dopamine Transporter Scan),"To evaluate dopamine transporter levels in the brain, which can help differentiate Parkinson's disease from other movement disorders."
4,Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS),To quantify the severity of symptoms and monitor progression over time.
5,Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Studies,"To assess the electrical activity of muscles and the speed of nerve conduction, helping to rule out peripheral neuropathy."
