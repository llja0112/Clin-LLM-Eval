0,Neurological examination,"To assess motor function, coordination, and balance, which are crucial in evaluating potential movement disorders."
1,Tremor assessment,"To characterize the tremors (resting, action, or postural) and determine their frequency and amplitude."
2,Gait analysis,To observe walking patterns and identify any abnormalities in gait that may indicate neurological issues.
3,Muscle tone assessment,"To evaluate for rigidity or stiffness, which can be indicative of conditions like Parkinson's disease."
4,Reflex testing,To assess deep tendon reflexes and any abnormalities that may suggest neurological involvement.
5,Postural stability assessment,"To evaluate balance and risk of falls, which is important given the reported walking difficulties."
6,Cranial nerve examination,To check for any deficits that may indicate neurological issues affecting motor control.
