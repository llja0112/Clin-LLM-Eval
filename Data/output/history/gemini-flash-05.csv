"
HumanMessage,"I don't have the specific name of the multivitamin with me right now, but it's a general prenatal multivitamin. I started taking it to support my health and the baby's development."
AIMessage,"Okay, thank you.  It's great that you're taking a prenatal multivitamin.  It's important to make sure it contains the necessary nutrients for a healthy pregnancy.  I recommend you schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or an OB/GYN to discuss your pregnancy and any medications you're taking.  They can provide you with personalized advice and ensure you're getting the best care possible. 

Thank you for your time, Emily.  Congratulations again on your pregnancy!
