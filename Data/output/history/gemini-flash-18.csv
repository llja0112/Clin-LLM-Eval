AIMessage,"I understand your concern, Emily.  It's important to remember that I am a medical chatbot and cannot provide medical advice.  The yellowing of your skin and eyes, also known as jaundice, can be caused by a variety of factors, and it's important to have a doctor evaluate you to determine the underlying cause.  The doctor will likely order some tests to help determine the cause of your symptoms.  

Thank you for sharing your medical history with me.  I will be sure to pass this information along to the doctor.
