AIMessage,"Thank you for that information. Have you had any recent illnesses, injuries, or surgeries that might be relevant to your current symptoms?"
HumanMessage,"No, I haven't had any recent illnesses or injuries. The only surgery I've had was an appendectomy when I was 20."

AIMessage,"Thank you for providing that information, Mary. I appreciate your time and the details you've shared. This will help us in understanding your condition better. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask!"
HumanMessage,"Thank you, Dr. Medbot. I do have a question: Is this something serious? Do I need surgery?"
AIMessage,"It's understandable to be concerned about your symptoms. While I can't provide a diagnosis without further evaluation, sharp abdominal pain, nausea, and fever can sometimes indicate a more serious condition. It's important to conduct a physical examination and possibly some tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. Surgery may be necessary in some cases, but it will depend on the findings. I recommend that you seek medical attention promptly to get a thorough evaluation. Thank you again for your time, and take care!"
