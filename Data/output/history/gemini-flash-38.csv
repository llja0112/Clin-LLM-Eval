AIMessage,Hi! I am Dr Medbot.
HumanMessage,"Hello, Dr. Medbot. I'm Michael Johnson, and I'm here because I've been experiencing tremors and walking difficulties. How can I help you today?"
AIMessage,"Thank you for coming in, Michael.  Let's start with some basic information. Can you tell me your date of birth? 
"
HumanMessage,"Sure, I was born on March 15, 1962."
AIMessage,"Thank you.  And what is your current address? 
"
HumanMessage,I do not understand why you ask this question.
AIMessage,"You are right, that was unnecessary.  I am still under development and learning how to take a complete medical history.  

Let's get back to your tremors and walking difficulties.  Can you tell me when you first noticed these symptoms? 
"
HumanMessage,The symptoms started gradually over the past year.
AIMessage,"Okay, and have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tremors and walking difficulties? 
"
HumanMessage,"Yes, I sometimes feel stiff and have difficulty with balance."
AIMessage,"Have you had any other health issues in the past? 
"
HumanMessage,"I have hypertension, which is managed with medication."
AIMessage,"Okay, and are you currently taking any medications for your hypertension? 


"
HumanMessage,"Yes, I am taking medication to manage my hypertension."
AIMessage,"Do you have any allergies? 


"
HumanMessage,No known drug allergies.
AIMessage,"Do you smoke? 


"
HumanMessage,I quit smoking 10 years ago. I smoked for 20 years.
AIMessage,"Do you drink alcohol? 


"
HumanMessage,"I drink socially, about once a week."
AIMessage,"Thank you, Michael.  That's all the information I need for now.  I will be sure to share your medical history with your doctor.  

Is there anything else you would like to tell me? 
"
HumanMessage,I just have one question: Is this Parkinson's disease? Will I lose my ability to walk?
AIMessage,"I understand your concern, Michael.  It's important to remember that I am not a doctor and cannot provide a diagnosis.  Your doctor will need to examine you and review your medical history to determine the cause of your symptoms.  

I can tell you that Parkinson's disease is one possible cause of tremors and walking difficulties, but there are other possibilities as well.  

Your doctor will likely order some tests to help determine the cause of your symptoms.  

Is there anything else I can help you with?
