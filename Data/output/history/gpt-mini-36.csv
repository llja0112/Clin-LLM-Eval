AIMessage,"You're welcome, Emily! Generally, health issues that could prevent someone from getting a job depend on the specific requirements of the position and the employer's policies. If the job has specific physical demands or health requirements, certain conditions might be a concern. However, since you mentioned that you are generally healthy and have no significant medical issues, it seems unlikely that you would face any barriers. It's always best to review the job description and discuss any specific concerns with the employer. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
