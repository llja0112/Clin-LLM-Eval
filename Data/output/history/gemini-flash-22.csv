AIMessage,Hi! I am Dr Medbot.
HumanMessage,"Hello, Dr. Medbot! I'm Michael Green, and I'm here because I've been experiencing dizziness. How can I help you today?"
AIMessage,"Thank you for coming in, Michael.  Can you tell me a little bit about the dizziness you've been experiencing? When did it start? 
"
HumanMessage,"Sure! The dizziness started a few days ago. It comes and goes, but I've been having episodes several times a day."
AIMessage,"Okay, and can you describe the dizziness? Is it a feeling of spinning, lightheadedness, or something else? 
"
HumanMessage,"It's more of a lightheaded feeling, and I feel a bit off-balance when it happens. It usually occurs when I stand up or move quickly."
AIMessage,"Interesting.  Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the dizziness? 
"
HumanMessage,"Yes, I've noticed occasional ringing in my ears, but no other symptoms like nausea or headaches. My vision has been fine as well."
AIMessage,"Okay, thank you.  Have you had any recent illnesses or injuries? 


"
HumanMessage,"No, I haven't had any recent infections or illnesses. I've been feeling generally well aside from the dizziness."
AIMessage,"Okay, and are you currently taking any medications? 
"
HumanMessage,"Yes, I'm taking medication for my blood pressure. That's the only medication I'm currently on."
AIMessage,"Okay, thank you.  Do you have any allergies? 


"
HumanMessage,"No, I don't have any known drug allergies."
AIMessage,"Okay, thank you.  Do you smoke or drink alcohol? 


"
HumanMessage,"I have never smoked, and I drink alcohol socially, about once a week."
AIMessage,"Okay, thank you.  Do you exercise regularly? 


"
HumanMessage,"I walk occasionally, but I wouldn't say I have a regular exercise routine. I try to stay active when I can."
AIMessage,"Okay, thank you.  Do you have a family history of any medical conditions? 


"
HumanMessage,"Yes, my father had hypertension, and my mother had diabetes. That's about it for my family history."
AIMessage,"Thank you, Michael. That's very helpful.  Is there anything else you'd like to add about your medical history? 


"
HumanMessage,"I don't think so. My past medical history includes hypertension, and I had an appendectomy about 20 years ago."
AIMessage,"Thank you, Michael. That's very helpful.  I appreciate you taking the time to share your medical history with me. 
"
HumanMessage,"You're welcome, Dr. Medbot! I'm glad to help. If you have any more questions or need further information, feel free to ask."
AIMessage,"Thank you, Michael. I will let you know if I need any further information.
