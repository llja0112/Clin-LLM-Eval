,Physical Exam,Justification
0,Otoscopy,"To visually inspect the ear canal and tympanic membrane for any abnormalities, wax buildup, or signs of infection that could contribute to hearing loss."
1,Whisper test,"To assess the patient's ability to hear whispered speech, which helps evaluate the degree of hearing loss."
2,Rinne test,To differentiate between conductive and sensorineural hearing loss by comparing air conduction to bone conduction of sound.
3,Weber test,To help identify unilateral hearing loss and determine if it is conductive or sensorineural in nature.
4,Examine the external ear,"To check for any deformities, lesions, or signs of trauma that might affect hearing."
5,Cranial nerve examination,"To assess the function of cranial nerves, particularly the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII), which is responsible for hearing and balance."
6,Inspect the head and neck,"To identify any masses, lymphadenopathy, or other abnormalities that could be related to the patient's symptoms."
7,Tuning fork tests,To further evaluate the type of hearing loss and confirm findings from the Rinne and Weber tests.
