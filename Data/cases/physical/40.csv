1,Vital signs measurement,"To confirm the initial vital signs provided and monitor for any changes, especially in heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature, which are critical in assessing the child's hemodynamic status."
2,Skin turgor assessment,"To check for signs of dehydration, as decreased skin turgor is a common indicator of fluid loss."
3,Capillary refill time,"To assess peripheral perfusion and circulatory status, which can be affected in dehydration and shock."
4,Abdominal examination,"To evaluate for any abdominal tenderness, distension, or abnormal bowel sounds that could indicate underlying gastrointestinal issues."
5,Oral cavity examination,"To assess for dryness of the mucous membranes, which is a sign of dehydration."
6,Eye examination,"To check for sunken eyes, which is a sign of dehydration, and to assess for any other abnormalities."
7,Neurological assessment,"To evaluate the child's level of consciousness and responsiveness, which can be affected by dehydration and electrolyte imbalances."
8,Respiratory examination,"To assess for any respiratory distress or abnormalities, as tachypnea can be a compensatory mechanism in metabolic acidosis due to dehydration."
