,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS),"The patient's symptoms of chest pain radiating to the left shoulder and arm, along with shortness of breath, nausea, and sweating, are classic signs of ACS, which includes unstable angina and myocardial infarction. His history of hypertension, high cholesterol, and family history of heart disease further support this diagnosis."
1,Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD),"The chest pain could be due to GERD, especially since the patient reports episodes after a big meal. GERD can mimic cardiac chest pain, and the patient's history of fast food consumption could contribute to this condition."
2,Pulmonary Embolism,"Although less likely given the presentation, pulmonary embolism should be considered due to the chest pain and shortness of breath. However, the lack of risk factors such as recent surgery or immobilization makes this less probable."
3,Aortic Dissection,"Aortic dissection can present with severe chest pain radiating to the back, but the patient's pain radiates to the left shoulder and arm. The elevated blood pressure could be a risk factor, but the presentation is not typical."
4,Costochondritis,"This condition involves inflammation of the chest wall and can cause chest pain. However, the radiation of pain to the left shoulder and arm and associated symptoms make this less likely."
5,Panic Attack,"The patient's anxiety and chest pain could be due to a panic attack, but the presence of physical symptoms like radiation of pain and sweating suggests a more organic cause."
