0,Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder,"The patient reports occasional use of marijuana, which can sometimes lead to hallucinations and psychotic symptoms, especially in individuals with a predisposition to mental health issues."
1,Brief Psychotic Disorder,"The sudden onset of hallucinations and the presence of stressors such as a recent job change and relocation could suggest a brief psychotic disorder, which is characterized by a sudden, short-term display of psychotic behavior."
2,Schizophrenia,"The presence of both auditory and visual hallucinations, along with social withdrawal and difficulty concentrating, could indicate schizophrenia, especially if symptoms persist beyond a month."

4,Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features,"The patient has a history of depression, and the current hallucinations could be a manifestation of a major depressive episode with psychotic features."
5,Anxiety Disorder with Psychotic Features,"The patient reports significant anxiety and a family history of anxiety disorder, which could lead to transient psychotic symptoms under stress."
