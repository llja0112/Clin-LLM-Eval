,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV),"The dizziness is triggered by changes in head position, such as standing up or moving quickly, and is associated with brief episodes lasting a few minutes, which is characteristic of BPPV."
1,Orthostatic Hypotension,"The dizziness occurs when standing up, which could indicate a drop in blood pressure upon standing, a common feature of orthostatic hypotension."
2,Meniere's Disease,"The patient reports occasional ringing in the ears (tinnitus) and dizziness, which are symptoms that can be associated with Meniere's disease."
3,Vestibular Neuritis,"Although there is no recent infection, the symptoms of dizziness and unsteadiness could be due to inflammation of the vestibular nerve, which can occur without a preceding infection."
4,Medication Side Effect,"The patient is on blood pressure medication, which can sometimes cause dizziness as a side effect."
5,Cervical Spondylosis,"Given the patient's age and symptoms of dizziness with head movement, cervical spondylosis could be a consideration due to potential vertebral artery compression."
