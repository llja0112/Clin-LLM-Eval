,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Presbycusis (age-related hearing loss),"The patient is 80 years old, and presbycusis is a common cause of hearing loss in the elderly. The gradual onset and progression of hearing loss, along with a family history of hearing loss in old age, support this diagnosis."
1,Noise-induced hearing loss,"The patient has a history of working in a factory for 30 years, which could have exposed him to loud noises, leading to noise-induced hearing loss. The gradual onset and progression are consistent with this condition."
2,Otosclerosis,"Although less common in this age group, otosclerosis can cause conductive hearing loss and is characterized by a gradual worsening of hearing. The absence of ear infections and discharge makes this a less likely but possible diagnosis."
3,Meniere's disease,"The patient reports occasional tinnitus, which can be associated with Meniere's disease. However, the absence of vertigo makes this diagnosis less likely."
4,Medication-induced ototoxicity,"While the patient is on blood pressure medication, some medications can cause ototoxicity leading to hearing loss. However, this is less likely given the lack of recent medication changes and the gradual onset."
5,Cerumen impaction,"Cerumen impaction can cause conductive hearing loss and is a common, easily treatable condition. However, the gradual onset and lack of ear discharge make this less likely."
