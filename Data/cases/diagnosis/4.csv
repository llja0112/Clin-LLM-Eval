,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Fracture of the right arm,"The patient presents with right arm pain following a motor vehicle accident, and moving the arm worsens the pain, suggesting a possible fracture."
1,Concussion,"The patient reports a headache and dizziness after the accident, which are common symptoms of a concussion, despite no loss of consciousness."
2,Cervical spine injury,"Given the mechanism of injury (motor vehicle accident) and symptoms of headache and dizziness, a cervical spine injury should be considered."
3,Soft tissue injury or contusion,"The aching and throbbing quality of the arm pain could indicate a soft tissue injury or contusion, common in motor vehicle accidents."
4,Intracranial hemorrhage,"Although less likely due to the absence of loss of consciousness or neurological deficits, an intracranial hemorrhage should be ruled out given the headache and dizziness."
