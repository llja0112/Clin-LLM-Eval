,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Rotator Cuff Injury,"The patient reports left arm pain that started after lifting a heavy box, which is a common mechanism for rotator cuff injuries. The pain is localized around the shoulder and worsens with movement, consistent with this diagnosis."
1,Shoulder Impingement Syndrome,"The patient's symptoms of shoulder pain exacerbated by movement and the history of lifting a heavy object suggest possible shoulder impingement, where tendons are compressed during shoulder movements."
2,Biceps Tendonitis,"The dull ache in the shoulder area and the history of lifting a heavy object could indicate inflammation of the biceps tendon, especially given the patient's age and activity."
3,Cervical Radiculopathy,"Although the pain does not radiate, cervical radiculopathy should be considered due to the patient's age and the location of pain, as nerve compression in the neck can sometimes present with shoulder pain."
4,Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder,"Given the patient's age and family history of arthritis, osteoarthritis could be a potential cause of shoulder pain, although the acute onset is less typical."
5,Myocardial Ischemia,"While the pain is not typical for cardiac issues (no radiation, shortness of breath, or sweating), left arm pain in a hypertensive patient should always raise suspicion for myocardial ischemia, especially in older adults."
