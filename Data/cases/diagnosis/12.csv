0,Cervical spondylosis,"The patient's age and symptoms of neck pain with limited range of motion suggest degenerative changes in the cervical spine, which are common in older adults."
1,Cervical strain or sprain,The history of a minor fall followed by persistent neck pain and stiffness could indicate a soft tissue injury such as a strain or sprain.
2,Cervical facet joint syndrome,"The aching and stiffness localized to the back of the neck, along with limited range of motion, could be due to facet joint arthritis or dysfunction."
3,Cervical disc herniation,"Although there is no radiation of pain, the fall could have caused a disc herniation, which can present with neck pain and stiffness."
4,Osteoarthritis of the cervical spine,"Given the patient's age and symptoms, osteoarthritis is a possible cause of the neck pain and stiffness."
5,Post-traumatic neck pain,"The onset of pain after a fall suggests a possible post-traumatic cause, even if the pain was not immediate."
6,Vertebral compression fracture,"Although less likely without immediate pain after the fall, a compression fracture could still be considered, especially in an older patient."
