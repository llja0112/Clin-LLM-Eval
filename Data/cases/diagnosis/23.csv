,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Knee Sprain or Strain,"The patient reports knee pain following a minor fall, with symptoms of aching and sharp pain upon movement, as well as slight swelling and stiffness. These are common symptoms of a knee sprain or strain, which can occur due to overstretching or tearing of ligaments or muscles around the knee."
1,Meniscal Tear,"The mechanism of injury (a fall during hiking) and the symptoms of pain, swelling, and stiffness suggest the possibility of a meniscal tear, which is a common knee injury that can occur with twisting or impact."
2,Patellar Tendinitis,"The patient's regular hiking and yoga activities, combined with the recent fall, could lead to patellar tendinitis, characterized by pain and discomfort in the knee, especially when bending or putting weight on it."
3,Knee Contusion,"The minor fall could have caused a knee contusion, which is a bruise of the knee tissue, leading to pain, swelling, and stiffness."
4,Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Injury,"Although less likely without a more significant trauma, an ACL injury could still be considered due to the mechanism of injury and the symptoms of pain and difficulty with weight-bearing activities."
