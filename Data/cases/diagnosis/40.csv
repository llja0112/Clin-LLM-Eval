,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Acute viral gastroenteritis,"The patient presents with multiple episodes of watery diarrhoea, fever, and vomiting, which are common symptoms of viral gastroenteritis. The presence of mucus in stools and the absence of blood also support this diagnosis."
1,Dehydration secondary to diarrhoea,"The patient shows signs of dehydration such as lethargy, irritability, sunken eyes, dry mouth, and crying without tears, which are likely due to fluid loss from diarrhoea and vomiting."
2,Bacterial gastroenteritis,"Although less likely due to the absence of blood in stools, bacterial gastroenteritis can present with similar symptoms, especially with the presence of mucus in stools."
3,Food intolerance or allergy,"The recent introduction of solid foods could have triggered a food intolerance or allergy, leading to diarrhoea and vomiting."
4,Rotavirus infection,"Rotavirus is a common cause of diarrhoea in infants and young children, and the symptoms align with the patient's presentation."
5,Lactose intolerance,"The combination of breastfeeding and formula feeding, along with recent dietary changes, could suggest lactose intolerance, especially if formula contains lactose."
