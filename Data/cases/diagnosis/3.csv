,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Lumbar Strain or Sprain,"The patient's back pain started after lifting a heavy box, which is a common cause of muscle strain or ligament sprain. The pain is localized to the lower back and is exacerbated by certain movements, consistent with a strain or sprain."
1,Herniated Disc,"The patient's occupation involves physical labor, which can lead to disc herniation. The worsening pain and stiffness, especially after lifting, could indicate a herniated disc pressing on spinal nerves."
2,Degenerative Disc Disease,"The patient is middle-aged and experiences recurrent back pain episodes, which could suggest degenerative changes in the spine. The dull, aching quality of the pain and morning stiffness are also indicative."
3,Facet Joint Syndrome,"The pain is localized to the lower back without radiation, and the patient experiences stiffness, which can be associated with facet joint issues. The pain worsening with prolonged sitting is also suggestive."
4,Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction,"The patient's pain is localized to the lower back and worsens with certain activities, which can be indicative of sacroiliac joint dysfunction, especially given the physical nature of his job."
5,Ankylosing Spondylitis,"Although less likely given the patient's age and lack of significant family history, the morning stiffness and chronic nature of the pain could suggest an inflammatory condition like ankylosing spondylitis."
