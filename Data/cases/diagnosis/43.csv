,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Viral pharyngitis,"The patient presents with a sore throat, fever, headache, and mild cough, which are common symptoms of viral infections such as the common cold or influenza. The absence of significant past medical history and the presence of fever support this diagnosis."
1,Bacterial pharyngitis (Streptococcal throat infection),"The sore throat, fever, and worsening symptoms over two days could indicate a bacterial infection, such as streptococcal pharyngitis. The patient's discomfort when swallowing and the absence of previous similar episodes also support this possibility."
2,Infectious mononucleosis,"The patient's age, fever, sore throat, and headache could suggest infectious mononucleosis, especially if there is lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly upon further examination."
3,Allergic rhinitis with post-nasal drip,"Although less likely due to the presence of fever, the scratchy throat and mild cough could be due to post-nasal drip from allergies, especially if the patient has a history of allergies or exposure to allergens."
4,Acute tonsillitis,"The symptoms of sore throat, fever, and difficulty swallowing could also indicate acute tonsillitis, which can be viral or bacterial in origin."
