0,Liver function tests (LFTs),"To assess the liver's ability to produce proteins and clear bilirubin, and to check for liver damage."
1,Complete blood count (CBC),"To check for signs of infection, anemia, or other hematological conditions."
2,Hepatitis panel,To rule out viral hepatitis as a cause of jaundice.
3,Abdominal ultrasound,"To visualize the liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts for any structural abnormalities or obstructions."
4,Bilirubin levels,"To quantify the level of bilirubin in the blood, which can help determine the cause of jaundice."
5,Coagulation profile,"To assess the liver's ability to produce clotting factors, as liver dysfunction can lead to coagulopathy."
6,Serum albumin,"To evaluate liver synthetic function, as low albumin can indicate chronic liver disease."
7,Autoimmune markers,To rule out autoimmune hepatitis or other autoimmune liver diseases.
8,Iron studies,"To check for hemochromatosis, which can cause liver damage and jaundice."
