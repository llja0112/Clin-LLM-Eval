,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT),"The patient presents with unilateral calf pain, swelling, and a history of prolonged walking, which are classic signs of DVT."
1,Muscle Strain,"The onset of pain followed a long period of walking, suggesting a possible muscle strain or overuse injury."
2,Calf Contusion,"The patient may have sustained a contusion during her activities, leading to localized pain and swelling."
3,Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD),"Although less likely given the patient's age and lack of significant risk factors, PAD can present with calf pain, especially with exertion."
4,Baker's Cyst,"A Baker's cyst can cause swelling and pain in the calf area, particularly if it ruptures."
5,Compartment Syndrome,"The sharp and throbbing pain, along with swelling, raises concern for compartment syndrome, especially if there is a history of trauma."
6,"Nerve Compression (e.g., Sciatica)","Localized pain in the calf could also be due to nerve compression, although this is less common."
7,"Infection (e.g., Cellulitis)","Mild swelling and pain could indicate an infection, especially if there are any breaks in the skin or other signs of infection."
