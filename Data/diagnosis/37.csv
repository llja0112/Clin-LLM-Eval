,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Diverticulosis,"The patient presents with bright red blood per rectum, which is a common presentation of diverticular bleeding. The age and mild abdominal discomfort also align with this condition."
1,Colorectal cancer,Family history of colon cancer and the patient's age are significant risk factors. The change in bowel habits and bloody stools warrant consideration of this diagnosis.
2,Hemorrhoids,Bright red blood on toilet paper and in the toilet bowl is typical of hemorrhoidal bleeding. The patient's history of increased bowel movement frequency and urgency could exacerbate hemorrhoids.
3,Anal fissure,"Bright red blood and mild abdominal discomfort could be due to an anal fissure, especially with increased bowel movement frequency."
4,Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),"Increased frequency and urgency of bowel movements, along with bloody stools, could indicate IBD, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease."
5,Ischemic colitis,"The patient's age and presentation of bloody stools with mild abdominal discomfort could suggest ischemic colitis, especially given occasional dizziness which might indicate transient ischemic episodes."
6,Angiodysplasia,"Common in older adults, angiodysplasia can cause painless rectal bleeding. The patient's age and presentation align with this possibility."
