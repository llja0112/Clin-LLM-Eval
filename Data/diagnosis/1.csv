,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS),"The patient's chest pain is severe, pressure-like, and radiates to the neck, upper back, and left arm, which are classic symptoms of ACS. The patient also has risk factors such as hypertension, high cholesterol, and cocaine use."
1,Pulmonary Embolism (PE),"The patient presents with chest pain and shortness of breath, which could indicate a PE, especially considering the recent history of cocaine use that may predispose to thromboembolic events."
2,Aortic Dissection,"The severe chest pain that radiates to the back and the patient's age raise suspicion for aortic dissection, which can present with similar symptoms."
3,Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD),"The patient has a history of GERD and has experienced similar episodes of chest pain that were relieved by antacids, suggesting that GERD could be a contributing factor."
4,Pneumothorax,"The patient's labored breathing and chest pain could indicate a pneumothorax, especially if there is a history of trauma or underlying lung disease."
5,Costochondritis,"The location of the pain and the fact that it is exacerbated by certain movements could suggest costochondritis, although the severity and associated symptoms make this less likely."
6,Esophageal Spasm,"The quality of the pain as pressure and the history of GERD could suggest esophageal spasm, which can mimic cardiac pain."
7,Myocardial Infarction (MI),"Given the patient's risk factors and the nature of the chest pain, an MI must be considered as a potential diagnosis."
