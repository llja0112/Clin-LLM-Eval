,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS),"The patient's chest pain is central, tight, and radiates to the left arm and jaw, which are classic symptoms of ACS. The history of hypertension and family history of heart disease further support this diagnosis."
0,Pulmonary Embolism (PE),"The patient presents with chest pain and shortness of breath, which could indicate a PE, especially considering the labored breathing and sweating."
0,Aortic Dissection,"The sudden onset of severe chest pain and the nature of the pain could suggest an aortic dissection, particularly given the patient's age and history."
0,Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD),"The patient has a history of similar episodes after heavy meals, which could indicate GERD, although the current episode is more severe."
0,Pneumothorax,"The patient's labored breathing and chest pain could suggest a pneumothorax, especially if there is a history of trauma or underlying lung disease."
0,Costochondritis,"The nature of the pain and the fact that it has occurred previously could suggest costochondritis, although the severity and associated symptoms make this less likely."
0,Esophageal Spasm,"The tightness in the chest and the history of similar episodes could indicate esophageal spasm, particularly if related to stress or heavy meals."
0,Myocardial Infarction (MI),"Given the patient's risk factors, including hypertension and family history, an MI must be considered, especially with the current presentation of chest pain."
