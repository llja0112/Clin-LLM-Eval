,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS),"The patient's chest pain is characteristic of angina, with pressure-like quality, radiation to the left arm, and risk factors including hypertension and a history of smoking."
0,Pulmonary Embolism (PE),"The patient presents with chest pain and slight labored breathing, which could indicate a PE, especially given the sudden onset of symptoms."
0,Aortic Dissection,"The severe chest pain with radiation could suggest an aortic dissection, particularly in a middle-aged male with hypertension."
0,Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD),"Although less likely given the presentation, GERD can cause chest pain that mimics cardiac pain, especially if there are no other alarming features."
0,Pneumothorax,"The labored breathing and chest pain could indicate a pneumothorax, particularly if there is a history of recent trauma or underlying lung disease."
0,Costochondritis,"This musculoskeletal condition can cause localized chest pain, but the radiation to the left arm and pressure-like quality makes it less likely."
0,Myocardial Infarction (MI),"Given the patient's risk factors and symptomatology, an MI must be considered as a potential cause of the chest pain."
0,Anxiety/Panic Attack,"The patient's anxiety and presentation could suggest a panic attack, which can present with chest pain and labored breathing."
