0,Aortic Dissection,"The radiation of pain to the neck and back, along with the acute onset, raises concern for aortic dissection."
0,Pulmonary Embolism (PE),"Mild shortness of breath and acute onset of pain could indicate a PE, especially in a patient with risk factors."
0,Cervical Radiculopathy,"The radiation of pain to the neck and back could suggest nerve root involvement, possibly due to cervical spine issues."
0,Myocardial Infarction (MI),"Similar to ACS, MI is a critical consideration given the patient's symptoms and risk factors."
0,Pneumothorax,"The mild shortness of breath and acute pain could suggest a pneumothorax, especially if there was any trauma."
0,Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD),"Although less likely, GERD can sometimes present with referred pain to the shoulder and chest discomfort."
