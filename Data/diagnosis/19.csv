,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Acute Otitis Media (AOM),"The child is tugging at his right ear, which is a common sign of ear pain associated with AOM. The recent history of a cold, irritability, fever, and decreased appetite further support this diagnosis."
1,Viral Upper Respiratory Infection (URI),"The child has a runny nose, mild cough, and fever, which are typical symptoms of a viral URI. The recent cold and exposure to sick contacts at daycare also support this possibility."
2,Teething,"At 8 months, teething is common and can cause irritability, mild fever, and ear pulling due to referred pain. However, the high fever and other symptoms make this less likely."
3,Bacterial Sinusitis,"Following a viral URI, bacterial sinusitis can develop, especially with persistent symptoms like runny nose and cough. However, the age of the child makes this less common."
4,Roseola Infantum,"Characterized by high fever followed by a rash, roseola is common in this age group. The absence of a rash makes this less likely at this stage, but it could develop later."
