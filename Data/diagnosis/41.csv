,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Primary Nocturnal Enuresis,"The child has a history of bed wetting almost every night with no daytime urinary symptoms, normal bowel habits, and no significant medical history. The father also had similar issues as a child, suggesting a possible genetic component."
1,Secondary Nocturnal Enuresis,"The onset of bed wetting started a few months ago, coinciding with starting a new school, which could be a psychosocial stressor. However, there are no other signs of stress or trauma."
2,Diabetes Insipidus,"The child drinks a lot of water before bed, which could suggest polydipsia, a symptom of diabetes insipidus. However, there are no other symptoms like polyuria during the day."
3,Urinary Tract Infection (UTI),"Although there are no daytime urinary symptoms or fever, a UTI can sometimes present with nocturnal enuresis in children."
4,Constipation,"While the child reports normal bowel habits, constipation can sometimes cause bed wetting due to pressure on the bladder."
5,Sleep Apnea,"The child sleeps through the night and doesn't wake up to urinate, which could suggest a sleep disorder like sleep apnea, although there are no other symptoms like snoring or daytime sleepiness."
