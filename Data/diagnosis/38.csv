,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Parkinson's Disease,"The patient presents with classic symptoms of Parkinson's disease, including resting tremor, shuffling gait, difficulty initiating movement, and reduced arm swing. The family history of Parkinson's disease further supports this diagnosis."
1,Essential Tremor,"Although the tremor improves with intentional movement, which is more characteristic of Parkinson's, essential tremor should be considered as it is a common cause of tremor in the elderly."
2,Multiple System Atrophy (MSA),"MSA can present with parkinsonian features such as tremor and gait difficulties, but typically includes autonomic dysfunction, which is not reported here. However, it remains a differential to consider."
3,Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP),"PSP can present with parkinsonian symptoms and gait difficulties, but usually includes vertical gaze palsy, which is not mentioned here. It is a less likely but possible differential."
4,Corticobasal Degeneration,"This condition can present with asymmetric parkinsonism and cognitive dysfunction, which are not reported here, but it remains a differential diagnosis for parkinsonian syndromes."
