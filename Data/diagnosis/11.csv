,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Laryngeal cancer,"Given the patient's age, smoking history, and new onset hoarseness, laryngeal cancer is a significant concern."
1,Vocal cord nodules or polyps,"As a teacher, the patient likely uses his voice extensively, which can lead to vocal cord nodules or polyps causing hoarseness."
2,Laryngitis,"Although the patient denies recent upper respiratory infections, laryngitis can occur due to overuse of the voice, which fits the patient's history."
3,Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),"The sensation of something stuck in the throat may suggest GERD, which can cause hoarseness due to acid irritation."
4,"Thyroid dysfunction (e.g., goiter or thyroiditis)","Thyroid issues can lead to voice changes and should be considered, especially in older adults."
5,"Neurological conditions (e.g., vocal cord paralysis)","Neurological issues can lead to hoarseness and should be evaluated, particularly given the patient's age."
6,Allergic rhinitis or post-nasal drip,"Although the patient denies cough or sore throat, post-nasal drip can cause throat irritation and hoarseness."
7,"Infectious causes (e.g., viral laryngitis)","While the patient has no recent infections, viral infections can still cause hoarseness and should be considered."
