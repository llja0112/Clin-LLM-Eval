,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT),"The patient's symptoms of right calf pain, swelling, and redness, along with a recent history of prolonged immobility during a long flight, are classic signs of DVT. The risk of DVT increases with prolonged immobility, such as during long flights."
1,Muscle Strain,"The patient reports aching pain in the right calf, which could be due to a muscle strain, especially if there was any recent physical activity or unusual exertion. However, the lack of a specific precipitating event makes this less likely."
2,Cellulitis,"The presence of swelling and redness in the calf could indicate cellulitis, a bacterial skin infection. However, the absence of fever and systemic symptoms makes this less likely."
3,Baker's Cyst Rupture,"A Baker's cyst rupture can cause calf pain and swelling, but it is usually associated with a history of knee problems, which the patient does not have."
4,Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD),"While less likely given the patient's age and lack of risk factors, PAD can cause leg pain, especially with exertion. However, the acute nature of the symptoms and the recent flight history make this diagnosis less probable."
