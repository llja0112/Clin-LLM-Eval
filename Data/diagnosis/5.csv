,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Normal Intrauterine Pregnancy,"The patient has a positive pregnancy test, symptoms consistent with early pregnancy (nausea, breast tenderness), and no significant risk factors or complications in her history."
1,Ectopic Pregnancy,"Although the patient presents with a positive pregnancy test and symptoms of early pregnancy, the inability to recall the last menstrual period and the history of missed contraceptive pills could suggest an ectopic pregnancy, which is a critical condition to rule out."
2,Molar Pregnancy,"While less common, a molar pregnancy could present with a positive pregnancy test and symptoms of pregnancy. It is important to consider this in the differential diagnosis, especially if the ultrasound shows abnormal findings."
3,Pregnancy of Unknown Location,"Given the uncertainty about the last menstrual period and the missed contraceptive pills, there is a possibility of a pregnancy of unknown location, which requires further investigation to confirm the location of the pregnancy."
