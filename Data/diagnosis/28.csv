,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Medication non-adherence,"The patient reports sometimes forgetting to take his antihypertensive medication, which could lead to poorly controlled blood pressure and symptoms like headache and fatigue."
1,Hypertensive headache,"The patient's elevated blood pressure (150/95 mm Hg) and mild headache could be related, as headaches are a common symptom of hypertension."
2,Secondary hypertension,"Given the patient's age and symptoms, secondary causes of hypertension such as renal artery stenosis or endocrine disorders should be considered, especially if blood pressure remains uncontrolled despite medication."
3,Chronic fatigue syndrome,"The patient reports feeling more tired than usual over the past few weeks, which could be indicative of chronic fatigue syndrome, although this is less likely given the context."
4,Depression,"Fatigue and mild headache can also be symptoms of depression, particularly in a retired individual who may be experiencing lifestyle changes."
