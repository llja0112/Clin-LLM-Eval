,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus,"The patient is an 11-year-old girl presenting with symptoms of increased thirst, frequent urination, and elevated glucose levels, which are classic signs of Type 1 Diabetes. The family history of diabetes also supports this possibility."
1,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,"Although less common in children, the increased appetite and family history of diabetes could suggest Type 2 Diabetes, especially if there are lifestyle factors contributing to insulin resistance."
2,Diabetes Insipidus,"The symptoms of increased thirst and urination could also be indicative of diabetes insipidus, a condition characterized by an imbalance of fluids in the body, although the elevated glucose test makes this less likely."
3,Stress-Induced Hyperglycemia,"The patient's anxiety and recent stress could potentially lead to transient hyperglycemia, although this is less common in children without underlying conditions."
4,Cushing's Syndrome,"Although rare, Cushing's syndrome can cause increased appetite and glucose levels, but the lack of other symptoms such as weight gain or characteristic physical features makes this less likely."
