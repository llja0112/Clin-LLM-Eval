,Diagnosis,Justification
0,Humeral fracture,"The patient reports severe pain in the left arm after a motor vehicle accident, which is consistent with a fracture."
0,Shoulder dislocation,"The mechanism of injury and the location of pain suggest a possible dislocation, especially with radiation of pain to the shoulder."
0,Rotator cuff injury,"The patient's occupation as a mechanic may predispose him to shoulder injuries, and the pain could be related to a rotator cuff tear."
0,Brachial plexus injury,The tingling in the fingers and pain radiation to the shoulder and neck may indicate a brachial plexus injury due to trauma.
0,Soft tissue injury (contusion or sprain),"Swelling and bruising in the arm could suggest a significant soft tissue injury, even in the absence of a fracture."
0,"Nerve injury (e.g., ulnar or median nerve injury)",The presence of tingling in the fingers raises concern for possible nerve injury related to the trauma.
0,Vascular injury,"Given the mechanism of injury, there is a risk of vascular compromise, which should be evaluated due to the swelling and pain."
0,Acute compartment syndrome,"The swelling and severe pain could indicate compartment syndrome, especially if there is significant swelling post-injury."
