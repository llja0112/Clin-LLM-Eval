0,Diverticulitis,"The patient's age, location of pain in the lower right abdomen, fever, and constipation are suggestive of diverticulitis, especially given the absence of an appendix."
1,Ovarian cyst or torsion,"The sudden onset of sharp, cramping pain in the lower right abdomen, along with nausea, could indicate an ovarian cyst or torsion, particularly in a female patient."
2,Kidney stone,"The sharp, cramping pain and nausea, along with the location of the pain, could suggest a kidney stone, although the absence of urinary symptoms makes this less likely."
3,Gastroenteritis,"The abdominal pain, nausea, and mild fever could be indicative of gastroenteritis, although the constipation and lack of diarrhea make this less likely."
4,Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID),"The lower abdominal pain, fever, and nausea could suggest PID, especially if there is a history of sexually transmitted infections, although this is not provided in the history."
5,Colonic obstruction,"The constipation, abdominal pain, and decreased appetite could suggest a colonic obstruction, although the patient does not report vomiting."
